                Hello, everybody, and welcome to my website.
            </span>
            <p>
                I am a Jazz guitar player residing in Southwest Florida. 
                Prior to my relocation down here in Paradise, I spent 
                over 40 years as a part of the thriving music scene in Chicago. 
                I performed with the best of the best, recorded three CDs and 
                written two books. As educator, I've passed down what I've 
                learned from the greats.
            </p>

                This site is where I'll post my gig calendar, my personal blog
                musings and links to my performing/instructional videos. 
                <i>Thanks for visiting â€” don't be a stranger!</i>
