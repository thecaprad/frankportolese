I built this website for jazz guitarist Frank Portolese â€” you can view it live at www.frankportolese.com. It features a blog and gig calendar which are managed by the artist himself using simple admin tools. It uses Python/Django on the backend, and HTML and Bootstrap on the frontend.

Frank is a dear friend, mentor and kick-ass guitar player(!)
